# TDD : Test Driven Development

### What is TDD?
Test-driven development (TDD) is an approach to software development where you write tests first, then use those tests to drive the design and development of your software application.

### Red, Green, Refactor, and then Repeat Approach
The red, green, refactor approach helps developers compartmentalize their focus into three phases:

- Red — think about what you want to develop
- Green — think about how to make your tests pass
- Refactor — think about how to improve your existing implementation

### Red
The red phase is always the starting point of the red, green, refactor cycle. The purpose of this phase is to write a test that informs the implementation of a feature. The test will only pass when the its expectations are met.

### Green
The green phase is where you implement code to make your test pass. The goal is to find a solution, without worrying about optimizing your implementation.

### Refactor
In the refactor phase, you are still “in the green.” You can begin thinking about how to implement your code better or more efficiently.
